<p><u>Attacking</u></p>
<p>Attacking will gain you experience when you win, but you lose experience if you lose. The amount of experience depends on the comparative
strength of your enemy, if they are much weaker, you won't get much experience</p>
<br />
<a name="fight"><h4>Attacking</h4>

<br />
<p>Attacking is a good way to get experience, and exert your superiority over those weaker than you. In order to attack you need 50% energy,
and should have a weapon. When you win a fight you will get a percentage of experience depending on how much stronger you are compared to the
person you are attacking. Make sure that you really want to fight the person, because once you start you can't stop until one of you loses.
When you start a fight, you will have the option of using any weapon that you currently have in your items page.<br />
<a name="gangs"><h4>Gangs</h4>
<br />
<p>Gangs are a group of players that band together to work for a common purpose, granted this may be robbing a bank, or taking down the losers
in a rival gang. Gangs cost \$500K to create, and once you buy it, you are the president of your gang. Your faction will initially be able to hold
5 members, but will be able to upgrade to more as time goes on. The President will be able to assign a Vice-President to the gang. Gangs are able to
do Organised Crimes for money and respect.The president can also select to go to war with another gang. One should be careful about doing this though,
as it may come back to haunt you.</p>
